# Installation

### downloading
First, go to [https://stickypiston-development.github.io/typegreek-windows/download](https://stickypiston-development.github.io/typegreek-windows/download).
Save the file somewhere on your local disk.
If your browser says: "This file is not being downloaded much and can be harmful",
click on "Keep this file"
This is not the program itself, but the installer.
It will install the program once you open it.

### windows defender
Open the file you downloaded.
A windows defender window will pop up now.
Because the program is free and we don't earn anything from it,
we did not buy a 300$ certificate.
If we bought that license windows defender would not show this screen.  
click on "more info" and then "run anyways"

### installing
In the license is written out that you may use it non-commercial,
And if you want to use it commercially, you have to ask the developer (MrStickyPiston) for permission.
We are assuming you are non-commercial. Accept the license.

Check the parts of TypeGreek Windows you want to install.
If you just want to use the program, don't check / uncheck anything.

Select a folder for the program to install into.
Any folder is ok, and changing it is not necessary.
Click install. The installer will install TypeGreek windows in the chosen directory.
A pop up notice says the program has been installed. You are done!
The program is now accessible from the start menu and the desktop screen.
Happy typing!
